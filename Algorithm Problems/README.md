# Algorithm Problems

## Problem 1

Given an array of size N and an integer T representing the count of available
threads, find all non-repeating elements in the array using multithreading.

## Problem 2

Implement a Heap in C++ using object oriented programming and dynamic
memory allocation.

## Problem 3

Stranger Things have started happening in the town of Hawkins, Indiana after
Will Byers disappeared last week. Will's friends Dustin, Mike, and Lucas discover
a psychokinetic girl, Eleven, who claims to know Will's location.
They gathered N kids from the neighbourhood (including them with their special
monster killing guns and went to the location given by Eleven. As soon as they
reach the place, they find an army of K deadly monsters ready to kill whatever
comes in their way. Eleven uses her psychic powers and finds a way to kill some
of the monsters.

A monster can be killed by a kid's gun if and only if the power of the monster is
divisible by the gun's power. Monsters are numbered from 1 to K and the power
of i-th monster is i. The power of the gun i-th kid is holding is a[i].
Find the maximum number of monsters the kids will be able to kill
