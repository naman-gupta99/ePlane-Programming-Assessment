# Full Stack Development Problem : ePlane Hailing App

## Problem

Orange is the new Black and Sky is the new road! The ePlane company is
developing Air-taxis that let you zoom from your house straight to the office or
the mall. We build the taxis but how do we let people use it? Thatâ€™s where you
come in. Develop a simple (you can decide the level of complexity and details of
implementation) ride-hailing app for the skies (Like Ola or Uber) using any
framework of your choice.

## Introduction

The app starts by getting the user logged-in using and OTP based authentication. Then the app accesses your current location and chooses it as the default pick-up position. The user can enter a location to search and use it as his pick up location. Once the user has choosen a pick-up location, the same proccess is followed to recieve the drop-off location. Then, the final screen shows the pick-up and drop-off location names and a static approved text to signify that your ePlane ride has been approved.

## Instructions to run the program

1. Download the eplane.apk file to an Android Phone

2. Install

3. Enter Phone Number

4. Enter the OTP

5. Choose a Pick-up Location

6. Choose a Drop-off location
